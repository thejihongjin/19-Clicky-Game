# Clicky Game
## Overview
Clicky Game is a memory game where users try and click on all images without clicking on the same image twice.

* On initial load, the application renders different images of the 2019 WWC Champions (woo!) to the screen.
* When the user clicks an image for the first time, the user's score is incremented and the images are shuffled. If the user clicks on an image that has already been clicked, the user's score is reset to 0 and the game restarts.
